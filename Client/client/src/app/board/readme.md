# Board

## Notes

-   Should be changed to use the VisDataService to handle access and formatting of 
    report data. 
    -   May have to alter vis data to be suitable to the task (recognising that it 
        was first written with charts in mind). 
    -   This includes altering the board data model somewhat. 
    
-   Should use our edit forms for cards. Might need some work on the form builder
    to be able to define the kind of layouts that we'd like (see separate
    project to improve our layout capabilities)*[]:
